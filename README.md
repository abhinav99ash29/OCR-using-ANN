# OCR-using-ANN
This repo contains the collection of neural network trainer and tester program along with customised dataset.
For using this repo first of all extract the number dataset and keep it in the same folder as the ocr_model_trainer_update
and after running this program a ann model is generated and saved in the same folder and using ocr_test_neural the accuracy of the model can be tested using a test image which should also be present in the same folder. By changing the parameters of the MLP the variations in accuracy can be observed and also models can be changed from mlp to svm or to logistic regression, etc. In ocr_test_neural the name of the test image must be changed.
